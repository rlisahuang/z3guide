The following example shows how to prove that if p implies q and q implies r, then p implies r. We accomplish that by showing that the negation is unsatisfiable.

In this example, conjecture is an alias for the conjecture we want to prove.","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"logic/Quantifiers":{"id":"logic/Quantifiers","title":"Quantifiers","description":"Z3 is a decision procedure for the combination of the previous quantifier-free theories.

Z3 can produce models for satisfiable formulas. Yet in many cases arbitrary models are insufficient and applications are really solving optimization problems: one or more values should be minimal or maximal. When there are multiple objectives, they should be combined using Pareto fronts, lexicographic priorities, or optimized independently. This section describes a feature exposed by Z3 that lets users formulate objective functions directly with Z3. Under the hood is a portfolio of approaches for solving linear optimization problems over SMT formulas, MaxSMT, and their combinations.","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"optimization/softconstraints":{"id":"optimization/softconstraints","title":"Soft Constraints","description":"The (assert-soft formula [id id]) command asserts a weighted soft constraint.
